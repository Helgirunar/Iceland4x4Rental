                Away from the crowded scenes of the more traversed tourist attractions in Iceland, up in the highlands, waits the ultimate adventure. The highlands hide away many of Iceland's natural jewels like the geothermal fields of Kerlingafjöll, the moss-covered lava fields of Eldhraun, the natural hot springs of Landmannalaugar and many more.

                                        The F206 involves some river crossing and is best suited for medium and large 4x4 vehicles. The road leads to the Lakagíga area, a photographic paradise of a historic cataclysm that occurred when the Laki volcano erupted in 1783, spewing ash over much of Europe.

                                        The northern part of this mountain road is considered very rough and is best suited only for the largest types of 4x4 vehicles. For those that do manage it, the scenery is one of the most impressive in all of Iceland

                                        In the shadow of the great volcano, Hekla, runs F225, better known as Landmannaleið. The way is rough, with a few rivers to cross, but leads directly into the Landmannalaugar area. During summer, a large 4x4 is recommended. During winter, a guided tour is recommended.
